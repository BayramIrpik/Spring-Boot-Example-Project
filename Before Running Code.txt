  If you want to use this project, you need to do some steps for the project to run flawlessly.

  First of all, you have to set the database to your own settings before running on application.properties files.I used mySql. If you are using the same database, 
you must change the username and password according to yours. But if you are using a different database, you should also change the database name and url part. And 
you need to add the pom.xml dependency for the database.Before you run the code, you need to create a schema in the database. In my project, the schema name is library. 
You can also see it in the link spring.datasource.url = jdbc: mysql: // localhost: 3306 / library. You can give the schema name library if you want, or you can change 
it and give a schema name of your own. Run the project after creating the schema in the database. Run the following sql commands.

SQL part:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSERT INTO library.roles (name) VALUES ('ADMIN');
INSERT INTO library.roles (name) VALUES ('USER');

INSERT INTO library.users (email, enabled, first_name, last_name, password) 
VALUES ('admin@admin.com', true, 'Admin', 'Admin', '$2a$10$8Z7LyN4Xf5Ad/l2xt3MD8.w1NlY1eUDR4dFMfUzqPTfsSGW7NUMKm');

INSERT INTO library.users_roles (user_id,role_id) VALUES (1,1);
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After running the sql commands, an admin user with admin@admin.com mail and password 12345678 has been created.It is only added from the sql section when adding admin, 
role information of normal users is added with code.The sql part is finished.

  E-mail is sent for confirmation in user registration. For this part, you need to write your e-mail address and password in the applications.properties file. For the 
spring.mail.username mail address, for the password in the spring.mail.password field.I used gmail. If you are using a different email, you should change the other parts 
accordingly.And as additional info for gmail, 'Less secure app access' should be turned on in the security section. Or you may get an error.


  Finally, weather information is shown in the project. Api key is required to show this information. You can register at https://openweathermap.org/ and get an api key 
  for free use. After getting the apikey, add it to the variable in the OpenWeatherMapService class.
